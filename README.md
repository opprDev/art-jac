Based on our early [Academic Responsive Template](https://github.com/opprDev/academic-responsive-template), the presented repository will have the source code for the webpage of [Professor Jacinto C. Nascimento](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~jan/). The [Academic Responsive JAC Page](https://github.com/opprDev/art-jac) is a free [Bootstrap-based theme](https://getbootstrap.com/) for academic purpose. Great for scholar and collegial landing pages, it is 100% mobile-friendly and looks amazing on any device.
